Technical Specification: “Promo Landing Page with Carousels and Product Catalog”
1. General Overview
   This project is a PHP- and MySQL-based web application with the primary goal of creating a promotional landing page for showcasing products. The main components are:

Product Carousels (by category): three carousels, each displaying up to 10 products from its assigned category.
Product Grid (Catalog): a full product listing loaded dynamically (lazy load), with filtering and sorting capabilities.
Integration with an external API (HTZone API) to retrieve and update product and category data.
Data management in a local MySQL database, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Role-based access (e.g., “guest,” “admin”) and protection against vulnerabilities.
Key requirement: mandatory use of:

jQuery for AJAX, DOM manipulation, and client-side scripts.
Bootstrap for responsive UI layout and styling.
MySQL as the database system for both development and production environments.
2. Goals and Objectives
   Create an impressive promotional landing page for displaying products.
   Properly integrate with the HTZone API for data synchronization (products, categories).
   Ensure a fast and user-friendly experience (filters, sorts, responsive design, lazy load) leveraging jQuery and Bootstrap.
   Implement a secure and scalable architecture, resilient to traffic spikes and security threats.
   Enable quick releases and updates via CI/CD pipelines and containerization (Docker).
3. HTZone API Details
   3.1. Base URL
   arduino
   https://storeapi.htzone.co.il/ext/O2zfcVu2t8gOB6nzSfFBu4joDYPH7s
   All requests should be made relative to this base address.

3.2. Endpoints
GET /categories

Returns a list of all product categories.
Example: GET /categories
GET /items/[category_id]

Returns a list of items, optionally filtered by category_id.
Example: GET /items/1 (to return products with category_id=1).
Query parameters:
category_id — if additional filtering is supported by the API.
3.3. Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

200: OK (Success)
400: Bad Request
401: Unauthorized (e.g., invalid API key)
404: Not Found
429: Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
500: Internal Server Error
Why is this needed? Properly handling error codes is crucial to log issues and inform users/administrators of any failures.

4. Functional Requirements
   4.1. Data Management
   API Integration (HtzoneApi)

Use the given Base URL, calling /categories and /items/[category_id].
Fetch categories and items, store/update them in the local MySQL database.
Handle and log errors (e.g., 401/429/500).
Safely construct and pass any query parameters (e.g., category_id) to the API.
Model Classes

Category: methods for retrieving category lists, category by ID, top categories, etc.
Item: methods for working with products (filtering, sorting, CRUD).
Proper relational link between Category and Item via category_id.
Use PDO (or a similar safe approach) when querying the MySQL database.
Database Initialization

An init_database.php script (or migrations) to create/update tables and seed initial data as needed.
Can be triggered manually or automatically on deployment, returning a status message on success/failure.
4.2. Data Display on the Website
Three Carousels

Each carousel shows up to 10 products from its designated category.
Server-side rendering with PHP to ensure immediate availability of product data on page load.
Use Bootstrap’s Carousel component or a jQuery slider plugin for smooth transitions.
Main Catalog (Grid)

Display a full list of products, either in a paginated layout or dynamic lazy load.
Use jQuery AJAX to fetch items in batches of 10.
Sorting (by price, name, etc.) and filtering (by category, price range, brand).
Animations (e.g., spinner or fade-in) during data fetching, possibly using Bootstrap Spinners.
Filtering from Carousels

A button beneath each carousel to filter the main product grid by that category.
Responsive Design (Bootstrap)

Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop form factors.
Use Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure flexible layouts.
4.3. Additional Functionality
Role-based Access

“Guest” users can only view the public catalog and carousels.
“Admin” users can create/edit/delete products and categories.
Simple authentication mechanism: a login form, storing password hashes in the database.
Action Logging

Log critical events (e.g., API sync, adding new products, errors) to a file or third-party service (e.g., Sentry).
Analytics (optional)

Track carousel views, product clicks, add-to-cart actions (if expanded in the future).
5. Non-Functional Requirements
   5.1. Architecture and Project Structure
   MVC approach or equivalent:
   Models (classes/Category.php, classes/Item.php, classes/HtzoneApi.php) for data logic.
   Controllers (app/Controllers/) for handling requests and invoking model methods.
   Views (PHP templates, Blade/Twig, etc.) for outputting HTML.
   Example structure:


project/
├── public/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── assets/  # CSS, JS, images
│   │   ├── css/
│   │   └── js/
│   └── ...
├── app/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   │   ├── HomeController.php
│   │   ├── CategoryController.php
│   │   └── ItemController.php
│   ├── Models/
│   │   ├── Category.php
│   │   ├── Item.php
│   │   └── HtzoneApi.php
│   ├── Views/
│   │   ├── layout.php
│   │   ├── index.php
│   │   ├── partials/
│   │   │   └── carousel.php
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── config/
│   ├── database.php  # MySQL connection details
│   └── app.php       # General settings
├── tests/
├── init_database.php
├── composer.json
├── docker-compose.yml
└── ...
Why is this needed? Layered architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and testability of the codebase.

5.2. Security
CSRF Protection

Generate a CSRF token when rendering forms.
Validate the token on POST/PUT/DELETE requests (especially admin actions).
XSS Mitigation

Escape user input via htmlspecialchars or appropriate templating functions.
Use safe output in templates.
SQL Injection Prevention

Use parameterized queries (PDO with bindValue/bindParam).
Role-based Access Control

Check permissions at the controller or middleware level.
Return a 403 (Forbidden) or redirect to login if insufficient privileges.
HTTPS

Strongly recommended for production to use TLS certificates.
Password Storage

Store only password hashes (password_hash with bcrypt/Argon2).
6. Performance
   Caching

Cache API responses if data is not updated frequently.
Cache results of complex queries (e.g., aggregate data).
Indexing

Add indexes on fields used frequently for filtering: e.g., category_id, brand, price.
Query Optimization

Use LIMIT/OFFSET for pagination.
Keep JOIN usage minimal where possible.
Frontend Optimization

Minify CSS/JS.
Lazy load images (jQuery plugins or native <img loading="lazy">).
Why is this needed? Faster load times improve user satisfaction, SEO, and reduce server load.

7. Technology Stack
   PHP 7.4+ (8.0+ recommended).
   MySQL as the main DBMS.
   Web Server: PHP built-in server for dev; Nginx/Apache in production.
   Framework (optional): Laravel, Symfony, or plain PHP, depending on team preference.
   Frontend:
   Bootstrap (grid, UI components).
   jQuery (AJAX, DOM manipulation).
8. Testing Plan
   8.1. Unit Tests
   PHPUnit / Codeception:
   Tests for Category methods (retrieving categories, linking items).
   Tests for Item methods (CRUD, filtering, sorting).
   Tests for HtzoneApi (handling responses, errors).
   8.2. Integration Tests
   Validation of real MySQL interactions and the live HTZone API.
   Check init_database.php functionality.
   Test the full cycle: “API request → DB write → frontend display.”
   8.3. E2E Tests
   Cypress/Selenium/Codeception (Acceptance):
   Verify page loading, carousel scrolling.
   Catalog filtering and sorting.
   Admin authorization and product management.
   Why is this needed? Automated testing reduces regression risk, ensures reliability, and speeds up releases.

9. CI/CD Approach
   Git
   Use a primary branch main/master; new features in feature/*.
   Docker
   A Dockerfile to build the PHP application (with MySQL client).
   A docker-compose.yml for web and db services.
   GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI)
   Pipeline for:
   Running tests (PHPUnit) on each push.
   Checking code style (PHP-CS-Fixer) if desired.
   Building Docker images and possibly deploying (staging/production).
   Why is this needed? Predictable deployments, automated testing, and reliable releases.

10. UI/UX Recommendations
    Responsive Design (Bootstrap)

Use the Bootstrap grid system (row, col-*) for different screen sizes.
Client-Side Validation

Validate forms (e.g., login) using jQuery.
Provide in-page error messages without full page reload.
Microanimations

Hover effects on product cards (Bootstrap utilities or jQuery fade/slide effects).
User-Friendly Navigation

Bootstrap Navbar for the header.
Category buttons/links, collapsible filter panels if needed.
Lazy Load

jQuery AJAX requests triggered on scroll-to-end.
Display a spinner (Bootstrap Spinner) during loading.
Why is this needed? Good UI/UX drives conversion rates, user retention, and overall impressions.

11. Sample Code Snippets
    11.1. Example of HTZone API Integration (HtzoneApi.php)
    class HtzoneApi {
    private $baseUrl = "https://storeapi.htzone.co.il/ext/O2zfcVu2t8gOB6nzSfFBu4joDYPH7s";

    public function getCategories() {
    $endpoint = $this->baseUrl . "/categories";
    $response = file_get_contents($endpoint); // Simplified, recommend cURL or Guzzle
    $data = json_decode($response, true);

        if (json_last_error() !== JSON_ERROR_NONE) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid JSON response");
        }

        return $data; // Array of categories
    }

    public function getItems($categoryId = null) {
    $endpoint = $this->baseUrl . "/items";
    if ($categoryId) {
    $endpoint .= "/" . (int)$categoryId;
    }
    $response = file_get_contents($endpoint);
    $data = json_decode($response, true);

        if (json_last_error() !== JSON_ERROR_NONE) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid JSON response");
        }

        return $data; // Array of products
    }
    }
    This is a basic example using file_get_contents(). A more robust approach would use cURL or Guzzle with response code checks and timeouts.

11.2. Example MySQL Table Structure

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS categories (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
description TEXT,
price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
brand VARCHAR(255),
category_id INT,
image_url VARCHAR(255),
stock INT,
FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(id)
);
11.3. Example for Loading Items (Item.php)

class Item {
protected $db; // PDO instance

    public function __construct($pdo) {
        $this->db = $pdo;
    }

    public function getItemsByCategory($categoryId, $limit = 10, $offset = 0) {
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM items
                WHERE category_id = :category_id
                LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset";
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare($sql);
        $stmt->bindValue(':category_id', $categoryId, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->bindValue(':limit', $limit, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->bindValue(':offset', $offset, PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $stmt->execute();

        return $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }
}
11.4. jQuery AJAX for Lazy Load (scripts.js)

$(document).ready(function() {
let offset = 0;
const limit = 10;

function loadItems() {
$.ajax({
url: 'ajax/getItems.php',
type: 'GET',
data: { offset: offset, limit: limit },
success: function(response) {
// Example: server returns HTML product cards
$('#item-container').append(response);
offset += limit;
},
error: function() {
alert('Error loading items');
}
});
}

// Lazy load on scroll
$(window).on('scroll', function() {
if($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() >= $(document).height()) {
loadItems();
}
});

// Initial load
loadItems();
});

13. Conclusion
    This document outlines:

The goals and scope of the promotional landing page.
The required stack (PHP/MySQL, Bootstrap, jQuery) along with essential security, architecture, and testing guidelines.
Detailed HTZone API usage (endpoints /categories and /items/[category_id], error codes, base URL).
A containerization approach (Docker), testing methodology (PHPUnit/Codeception, E2E), and CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions).
By following these recommendations, you’ll have a modern, flexible, and secure landing page, capable of handling both small and growing data and traffic demands. The structure allows for easy expansion (e.g., role-based features, logging, analytics) and improvements as the project evolves. Good luck with the implementation!
